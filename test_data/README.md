Here we have provided a very small test example to ensure correct installation of `scPyDR`.

The directory `lab6_subsets` contains the barcodes, features, and matrix files for a subset of the GSM5114461_S6_A11 sample from this paper: [Functional, metabolic and transcriptional maturation of human pancreatic islets derived
from stem cells](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01219-z.pdf). The subset contains the first 300 rows and the first 300 columns (300 features and 300 cells) of the entire dataset.

Below is the code output when checking the line counts
