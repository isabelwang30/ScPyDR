# Benchmark Data

The directory `benchmark/data` contains a subset of UCSD's sp'24 CSE 185 lab 6 data (10x barcodes, features, and matrix) used as an example to run scPyDR upon installation, as well as for benchmarking scPyDR's PCA and UMAP functions against scanpy's versions. These files are the entire datasets from the GSM5114474_M3_E7 samples from the paper [Functional, metabolic and transcriptional maturation of human pancreatic islets derived from stem cells](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01219-z.pdf).
