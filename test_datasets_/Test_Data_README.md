We have two sample datasets currently:
=========

**1)** Lab 6 data subset which is the subset from GSM5114461_S6_A11 group. From this data we took the first 300 rows and the first 300 columns (300 features and 300 cells)

Below is the code output when checking the line counts

**2)** We will also be using data accessible at the link below. An online tutorial goes step by step and we are using this dataset to ensure that our pca is running correctly.
